# Volatage_regulation circuit 
This task is to design a voltage regulation circuit. This circuit contains dc voltage source, 2 capacitors, 1 resistor, 1 red-LED, dc voltmeter, and 7805 5V regulator.
The objective of this task is to regulate ranges input voltage that comes from the dc voltage source and use it to supply a specific loads that need a low voltage like LEDs. When the input voltage is equal to 12V, I have observed that the LED is on and the output voltage is equal to 5V because the 7805 5V regulator regulated the 12V to 5V. When the input voltage is equal to 35V, I have observed that the LED is on and the output voltage is also equal to 5V because the 7805 5V regulator regulated the 35V to 5V.
